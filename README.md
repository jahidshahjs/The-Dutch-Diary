# The-Dutch-Diary
I came to the Netherlands in 2017 to do my MSc at the University of Twente and have been living the Dutch life ever since. I created the Dutch Diary so you can live a better Dutch life. Whether you visit the Netherlands or live here, I'm sure you'll find something you like here. Enjoy!
